# [Chance's Party App](http://chancesnow.me/party)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chances/party-server.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/chances/party-server)

A party web app to facilitate guest interaction at your parties.

This application tightly integrates with the [Spotify Web API]() to help party hosts and guests curate a playlist of music as well as keep a guest list for a party.

## Contributing


The project is still quite experimental, but if you'd still like to help contribute you're more than welcome to.

1. Inspect the [TODO.md](TODO.md) document for new work.

2. Pick something farther down the list because I'm working top-down and have likely already started on those.

3. Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document for further instructions.
